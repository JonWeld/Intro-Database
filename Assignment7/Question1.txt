One of the easiest ways to encrypt a database is to have the cipher version of DB_Browser installed and use its encryption in the tools drop down menu.
You can also use the sqlite_dbconfig_defensive flag to prevent potential database file corruptions from sql statements.
You also have the option to change one of many limit settings to prevent denial of service attacks from large inputs.
Another thing you can do is you can go into the windows file settings and manually change who can access or modify the database file.
